Bio
======    
Hi, I am Huidong Hou, normally go by Jerry for the sake of pronunciation. I am an incoming first year master's student in ECE at [Georgia Tech](https://ece.gatech.edu/) from Fall 2025, with aim to perform research on developing general purpose robotics.

I completed my B.S degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science at Boston College, MA, where I worked on utilizing generic radio frequency signals for eavesdropping protection under [Prof. Donglai Wei](https://donglaiw.github.io/) and [Prof. Siddhartan Govindasamy](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/engineering/people/faculty-directory/siddhartan-govindasamy.html).

I was working as a Technical Fellow in the Advanced Technology Group at United Parcel Service(UPS), and later, a system Engineer in the BaSE(Building and Systems Integration) group from July 2023 to July 2025. I helped analyed data for the marketing team to help identify potential area for improvements, built internal tools that facilitate the workforce, and mostly working in warehouse to support the functionality of converyer builts. 

During the course of my work I was fortunate to gain a more deep knowledge into robotics and especially about humanoids, that motivated me to pursue a further study in Electrical and Computer Engineering to see how I could develop such tools with a more mature understanding of the real world revolves around us.
