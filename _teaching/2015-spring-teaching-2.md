This course provides a foundational introduction to complex variables. We begin by exploring complex numbers, their geometric representations in the complex plane (Cartesian and polar coordinates), and the concept of the Riemann sphere. The core of the course focuses on analytic (holomorphic) functions, covering complex limits, continuity, derivatives, and the essential Cauchy-Riemann equations. We will examine key examples, including the complex exponential, trigonometric, and logarithmic functions.  A significant portion of the course is dedicated to complex integration, introducing line integrals, Cauchy's Theorem, and Cauchy's Integral Formula. We will then delve into the local properties of holomorphic functions, such as zeros, poles, and the maximum principle, culminating in the powerful Residue Theorem and its diverse applications, infinite series and product expansions, analytic continuation, an introduction to special functions (e.g., Gamma and Riemann zeta functions), and MÃ¶bius transformations.
